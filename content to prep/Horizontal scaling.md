### **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)**

Horizontal scaling involves adding more servers to a system to distribute the load. This type of scaling allows the system to accommodate higher levels of traffic and data volume by spreading the load across multiple machines.

#### Benefits of Horizontal Scaling:

- **Scalability**: There's no theoretical limit to how many servers you can add to a system, making it suitable for handling large amounts of data and traffic.
- **Fault Tolerance**: By distributing the system across multiple servers, horizontal scaling reduces the risk of a single point of failure.
- **Flexibility**: Resources can be added incrementally, meaning you can add or remove servers as needed.

#### Challenges:

- **Complexity**: Managing multiple servers introduces additional complexity, such as load balancing, data consistency, and synchronization across machines.
- **Cost**: Although adding cheaper commodity hardware is often more cost-effective than vertical scaling, managing a large number of servers can still be expensive.
