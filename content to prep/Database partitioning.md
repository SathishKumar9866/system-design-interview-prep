### **Database Partitioning (Sharding)**

Database partitioning involves dividing a large database into smaller, more manageable pieces, called shards. Each shard contains a subset of the data and is hosted on a separate server. Sharding helps distribute data across multiple servers, allowing the system to handle larger datasets and traffic.

#### Types of Sharding:

- **Range-based Sharding**: Data is divided based on ranges of values (e.g., date or alphabetical order).
- **Hash-based Sharding**: Data is divided based on the output of a hash function.
- **Geographic Sharding**: Data is divided based on geographical location.

#### Benefits:

- **Scalability**: By distributing data across multiple servers, sharding allows a system to handle larger datasets and more queries.
- **Improved Performance**: Each server only handles a subset of the data, which can reduce the load on individual servers and improve query performance.

#### Challenges:

- **Complexity**: Implementing and maintaining sharding can be complex, especially as the number of shards increases.
- **Data Rebalancing**: When the distribution of data becomes uneven across shards, rebalancing can be expensive and disruptive to the system.
