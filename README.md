# System Design Interview Preparation 

Welcome to the **System Design Interview Prep** repository! This repository is designed to help software engineers prepare for system design interviews by providing comprehensive resources, examples, and study materials. 

I am learning and making study materials for preparation. 

** Documenting my journey of continuous learning and growth through daily challenges. **

## Introduction

System design interviews are a critical part of the technical interview process for many software engineering roles. These interviews evaluate your ability to design scalable, high-performing, and fault-tolerant systems. This repository serves as a one-stop resource to help you master these concepts and ace your interviews.

The content provided here will walk you through the foundational principles of system design, offer real-world examples, and provide tips on how to approach design problems.
## Why System Design?

System design interviews assess your ability to:
- Build large-scale, distributed systems.
- Make trade-offs between performance, scalability, consistency, and availability.
- Work with databases, caches, load balancers, and other infrastructure components.
- Architect solutions under ambiguous requirements.
- Demonstrate your knowledge of real-world technologies and practices.

Mastering system design not only helps you in interviews but also makes you a better software engineer by providing you with the skills to tackle complex challenges in real-world applications.

## Topics Covered
%% ### Basics

- **Vertical Scaling**: How to scale systems by upgrading hardware.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: How to distribute load across multiple servers.
- **Caching**: Using temporary storage to improve system performance.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing traffic evenly to avoid overloading a server.
- **Database Replication**: Ensuring high availability and fault tolerance by copying data across multiple servers.
- **Database Partitioning (Sharding)**: Dividing databases into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- **Cloning**: Creating identical copies of systems for scalability and fault tolerance.
### Advanced Concepts

- **CAP Theorem**: Understanding the trade-offs between Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance in distributed systems.
- **Consistency Models**: Strong consistency, eventual consistency, and their implications.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Decoupling components with events to improve scalability and flexibility.
- **Microservices**: Breaking down monolithic applications into smaller, independent services.
### Case Studies

Real-world examples of how large-scale systems like **Twitter**, **Instagram**, **Uber**, and **WhatsApp** are designed to handle millions of users.
### Mock Interviews

Mock system design interview examples that simulate the interview process and help you practice designing systems on the spot. %%
## How to Use this Repository

1. **Start with the basics**: Begin with foundational topics like scaling, caching, and database design in the `Basics` section. These are core concepts that you’ll need to understand for any system design interview.
   
2. **Move on to advanced topics**: Once you’ve mastered the basics, explore more advanced subjects like CAP theorem, microservices, and event-driven architectures.
%% 3. **Study case studies**: Review real-world system design examples to see how large-scale applications are built. This will help you understand practical applications of the concepts you've learned.
4. **Practice with mock interviews**: Use the `MockInterviews` section to simulate actual system design interviews. Try solving these on a whiteboard or in front of a peer to replicate interview conditions.
5. **Contribute**: If you find any mistakes or want to add new topics, feel free to contribute! Check out the `Contributing.md` file for more information. %%
## Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community! If you want to add new topics, fix errors, or provide better examples, please read our [[Contributing]] to get started.
Here’s how you can contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Make your changes.
4. Submit a pull request.
We appreciate all the contributions that help make this resource more valuable for everyone.
### Obsidian Setup 

- To use Markdown links from the start so you don’t have to convert them later, 
	- disable Settings > Files & Links > Use Wikilinks.
- Once you do that, you can still type the double brackets (you have to if you want autocomplete suggestions), and they will convert to Markdown when completed.
