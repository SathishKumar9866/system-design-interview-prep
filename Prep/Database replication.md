### **Database Replication**

Database replication involves copying and maintaining data across multiple database servers to improve availability, fault tolerance, and performance. The idea is that if one database server fails, another can take over, ensuring the system remains available.

#### Types of Replication:

- **Master-Slave Replication**: In this setup, the master database handles all writes, while slave databases copy data from the master and handle reads. This reduces the load on the master database.
- **Master-Master Replication**: All nodes can handle both reads and writes, which can improve performance but also increase the complexity of maintaining consistency across nodes.

#### Benefits:

- **Improved Availability**: In case one server fails, others can take over, ensuring continuous availability.
- **Improved Read Performance**: By offloading read operations to replicas, the load on the primary database can be reduced.

#### Challenges:

- **Data Consistency**: Maintaining consistent data across multiple servers can be complex, especially in master-master replication.
- **Latency**: Delays in data propagation between the master and replicas may lead to outdated data being served by replica nodes.
