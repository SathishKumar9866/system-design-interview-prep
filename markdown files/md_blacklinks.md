Let's review your code and refine it to handle all cases and ensure the changes are saved to the files. We'll also add exception handling, debugging, and save the changes to the files.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Not Saving Changes**: Currently, the script reads the markdown files and processes them but does not write the updated content back to the files.
2. **Link Matching Issues**: The script assumes filenames will always match exactly after replacing spaces with hyphens, which might not always be the case. It should handle both spaces and hyphens more flexibly.
3. **Error Handling**: There's no exception handling, which is important when working with file I/O or patterns that might not match.
4. **Debugging Output**: There’s a need to debug how filenames and paths are matched, and ensure that all markdown files are processed as expected.

### Steps to Fix:
1. Add **file writing** to save changes to disk.
2. Improve the **filename matching** logic by considering edge cases where filenames may have spaces, hyphens, or be slightly different.
3. Add **exception handling** to catch and report errors, while ensuring the script continues to run for other files.
4. Clean up and add appropriate **debugging messages** to trace what the script is doing at each step.

Here’s an updated version of your script:

### Updated Python Script:

```python
import os
import re

# Function to convert Obsidian-style links to GitHub markdown links
def convert_obsidian_to_github(text, repo_url, current_file_path, all_md_files):
    pattern = r'\[\[([^\]]+)\]\]'  # Matches Obsidian-style [[link]]
    
    def replace_link(match):
        note_name = match.group(1)
        note_file_variations = [
            note_name.replace(' ', '-') + ".md",  # Replace spaces with hyphens
            note_name.replace(' ', '_') + ".md",  # Replace spaces with underscores
            note_name + ".md"  # Keep spaces if any
        ]
        
        # Debug: Print possible filename variations
        print(f"Possible filenames for note '{note_name}': {note_file_variations}")
        
        # Search for the corresponding markdown file
        for md_file in all_md_files:
            if any(md_file.endswith(variation) for variation in note_file_variations):
                # Convert local path to GitHub URL
                rel_path = os.path.relpath(md_file, start=os.path.dirname(current_file_path))
                rel_path = rel_path.replace("\\", "/")  # Ensure URL uses forward slashes
                github_link = f"{repo_url}/{rel_path}"
                
                print(f"Converted link for '{note_name}': [{note_name}]({github_link})")
                return f"[{note_name}]({github_link})"
        
        # If no matching file is found, return the original link (to avoid broken links)
        print(f"No matching file found for note: {note_name}")
        return f"[[{note_name}]]"
    
    # Replace all [[...]] links with GitHub links
    return re.sub(pattern, replace_link, text)

# Function to recursively find all markdown files in a directory
def find_all_md_files(root_dir):
    md_files = []
    for subdir, _, files in os.walk(root_dir):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith(".md"):
                md_files.append(os.path.join(subdir, file))
    # Debug: Print all found markdown files
    print(f"Found markdown files: {md_files}")
    return md_files

# Function to process each markdown file and update content
def process_md_files(root_dir, repo_url):
    # Find all markdown files
    all_md_files = find_all_md_files(root_dir)
    
    # Process each markdown file
    for md_file in all_md_files:
        try:
            with open(md_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                content = f.read()

            # Convert the content for GitHub links
            updated_content = convert_obsidian_to_github(content, repo_url, md_file, all_md_files)

            # If content has been updated, write it back to the file
            if updated_content != content:
                with open(md_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                    f.write(updated_content)
                print(f"Updated links in {md_file}")
            else:
                print(f"No changes needed in {md_file}")
        
        except Exception as e:
            # Print error message and continue with other files
            print(f"Error processing file {md_file}: {e}")

# Main function to run the script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Set the root directory to the location of your local markdown files
    root_directory = r"C:\Users\devil\Downloads\ubuntu_backup\system_design_interview_prep"
    
    # Set the base URL of your GitHub repository (ensure it points to the correct branch for markdown files)
    github_repo_url = r"https://github.com/SathishKumar9866/system-design-interview-prep/blob/backlinks_test"
    
    # Process all markdown files in the directory
    process_md_files(root_directory, github_repo_url)
```

### Key Changes:

1. **Saving Changes to Files**: 
   - The script now saves the updated content back to the markdown file if any changes were made.
   - We use `with open(md_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8')` to write the updated content.

2. **Filename Matching Logic**:
   - I added multiple possible variations of file names (e.g., handling spaces as `-`, `_`, or preserving spaces). This makes the filename matching more robust.
   - It prints possible file variations and tries to match any of them.

3. **Debugging**:
   - Added debugging messages to trace:
     - All found markdown files.
     - Possible filenames for each Obsidian link.
     - Converted links and any failures in matching.
   
4. **Exception Handling**:
   - Wrapped file reading and writing in a `try-except` block to catch any file I/O errors.
   - If an error occurs (e.g., file not found or encoding issues), it prints the error and continues processing other files.

5. **Comparison Before Writing**:
   - The script compares the updated content with the original. If there’s no change, it skips writing to the file.

### Next Steps:

1. **Run the Script**: 
   - You can run this updated script on your local system. It will process each `.md` file and update the links as needed.
   - Make sure the `root_directory` points to your Obsidian markdown vault, and the `github_repo_url` is set to the base URL of your GitHub repository.

2. **Test Changes**:
   - After running the script, review the files in your local repository to ensure all links have been converted correctly.

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Once you're satisfied with the changes, commit and push the updated markdown files to your GitHub repository.
