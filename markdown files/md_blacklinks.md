To directly update Obsidian-style `[[...]]` links in your markdown files so they point to the appropriate URLs in your GitHub repository (and not the local paths), you can use the following approach:

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Goal:** Convert all `[[...]]` links in your local markdown files to GitHub-compatible markdown links. The links should point directly to your GitHub repository's markdown files and not local copies.
  
2. **Scope:** The changes should only be visible in your GitHub repository (e.g., for the GitHub Pages site) and **not** affect the local versions of your files.

### Key Requirements:
- **GitHub URLs:** Replace Obsidian `[[...]]` links with the correct GitHub URL.
- **File structure awareness:** Ensure all links point to the correct markdown files in the repository.
- **Avoid local changes:** The local files should retain the `[[...]]` links; changes should only affect the GitHub repository.

### Solution Outline:
Weâ€™ll create a Python script that:
1. **Finds all `.md` files** recursively.
2. **Replaces `[[...]]` links** with GitHub markdown links pointing to the corresponding files in your GitHub repository.
3. **Performs in-memory changes** without modifying your local files directly. You can run this script in a temporary branch that you push to GitHub, ensuring the changes are only visible on GitHub.

### Python Script to Convert Obsidian Links to GitHub URLs:

```python
import os
import re

# Function to convert Obsidian-style links to GitHub markdown links
def convert_obsidian_to_github(text, repo_url, current_file_path, all_md_files):
    pattern = r'\[\[([^\]]+)\]\]'  # Matches Obsidian-style [[link]]
    
    def replace_link(match):
        note_name = match.group(1)
        note_file = note_name.replace(' ', '-') + ".md"  # Normalize filename (spaces to hyphens)
        
        # Search for the corresponding markdown file
        for md_file in all_md_files:
            if md_file.endswith(note_file):
                # Convert local path to GitHub URL
                rel_path = os.path.relpath(md_file, start=os.path.dirname(current_file_path))
                rel_path = rel_path.replace("\\", "/")  # Ensure URL uses forward slashes
                github_link = f"{repo_url}/{rel_path}"
                return f"[{note_name}]({github_link})"
        
        # If no matching file is found, return the original link (to avoid broken links)
        return f"[[{note_name}]]"
    
    # Replace all [[...]] links with GitHub links
    return re.sub(pattern, replace_link, text)

# Function to recursively find all markdown files in a directory
def find_all_md_files(root_dir):
    md_files = []
    for subdir, _, files in os.walk(root_dir):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith(".md"):
                md_files.append(os.path.join(subdir, file))
    return md_files

# Function to process each markdown file and print updated content for GitHub
def process_md_files(root_dir, repo_url):
    # Find all markdown files
    all_md_files = find_all_md_files(root_dir)
    
    # Process each markdown file
    for md_file in all_md_files:
        with open(md_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            content = f.read()
        
        # Convert the content for GitHub links
        updated_content = convert_obsidian_to_github(content, repo_url, md_file, all_md_files)
        
        # Print the updated content (this is where you'd handle GitHub-specific logic)
        print(f"Processed file: {md_file}")
        print(updated_content)  # Output to console for now (could be written to GitHub)

# Main function to run the script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Set the root directory to the location of your local markdown files
    root_directory = "path/to/your/obsidian-vault-or-markdown-files"
    
    # Set the base URL of your GitHub repository (ensure it points to the correct branch for markdown files)
    github_repo_url = "https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/blob/main"
    
    # Process all markdown files in the directory
    process_md_files(root_directory, github_repo_url)
```

### How the Script Works:

1. **`convert_obsidian_to_github`:**
   - Finds and replaces `[[link]]` with `[link](github-url)`.
   - It first looks for all `.md` files in your local directory and maps them to GitHub URLs.
   - If a corresponding markdown file is found, the relative path is calculated, converted to a GitHub URL, and used to replace the link.

2. **`find_all_md_files`:**
   - Recursively searches the directory and subdirectories for all `.md` files.

3. **`process_md_files`:**
   - Reads each `.md` file, converts the `[[...]]` links to GitHub URLs, and prints the updated content. This simulates what would be sent to GitHub without changing local files.

### Steps to Use the Script:

1. **Adjust the Paths:**
   - Set `root_directory` to point to your local directory of markdown files (your Obsidian vault).
   - Set `github_repo_url` to point to your GitHub repository, ensuring the link includes the `blob/main/` (or the appropriate branch).

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Run the script in your Python environment. It will process each markdown file and print out the updated content that includes GitHub markdown links.

3. **Push Changes to GitHub (Optional):**
   - If you want to apply these changes directly to GitHub without affecting local files, you could create a **temporary branch** and modify the script to write the changes to that branch.
   - After reviewing the output, you can manually copy the changes or automate the process to push the updates to the GitHub repository.

### Key Considerations:

1. **Link Structure:**
   - The script assumes that file names in your Obsidian vault are formatted similarly to how they will be on GitHub. If you have specific file-naming conventions (e.g., spaces to hyphens), the script adjusts them accordingly.

2. **Avoiding Local Changes:**
   - This script doesn't modify your local files directly. It prints the updated markdown with GitHub links, which you can then push to GitHub or apply in a temporary branch.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - If a corresponding markdown file is not found for a `[[...]]` link, the script leaves the link as-is to avoid breaking anything. You can customize this behavior based on your needs.

4. **Reasoning for Each Step:**
   - **File Search:** Recursively finding all markdown files ensures that all links, regardless of their location, are converted.
   - **Relative Path Calculation:** Calculating the relative path ensures the converted links work correctly across directories, as GitHub markdown relies on correct relative paths.
   - **GitHub URLs:** The `github_repo_url` variable allows for flexible deployment across different repositories or branches.

### Next Steps:

- **Testing:** Run the script and check the output to ensure all links are correctly replaced with GitHub URLs.
- **Customizing for GitHub Pages:** If you're using GitHub Pages, ensure the URLs are compatible with how your site is structured.
- **Automating Push to GitHub:** Once you're confident in the output, you can adapt the script to automate the process of pushing these changes to your GitHub repository.

This approach ensures that your Obsidian notes are smoothly converted for GitHub without affecting your local files. How does this solution sound for your needs?
