To meet your updated requirement, Iâ€™ve modified the script so that:

1. **File Renaming:** It will first rename all markdown files in your directory that contain spaces by replacing the spaces with hyphens (`-`).
2. **Link Conversion:** After renaming the files, the script will update all `[[...]]` links in the markdown files to reflect these new filenames and convert them into GitHub-style links.
3. **Saving Changes:** The script will save all changes (both file renames and backlink updates) in your local repository.

### Updated Python Script

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **File Renaming**:
   - The function `rename_files_with_hyphens` will rename any `.md` file that contains spaces in its name by replacing spaces with hyphens.
   - It logs each rename operation and returns a dictionary (`renamed_files`) mapping old file paths to new file paths.

2. **Link Conversion After Renaming**:
   - After renaming the files, the `process_md_files` function calls `find_all_md_files` to get the updated list of markdown files and processes each one for Obsidian-style backlinks.
   - The links are then converted to GitHub markdown links with hyphenated filenames, ensuring consistency.

3. **Markdown Link Updates**:
   - The function `convert_obsidian_to_github` updates the internal backlinks to use the newly hyphenated filenames in the correct GitHub markdown link format.

### Example:

#### Before:

- **File**: `Common Principles.md`
- **Link**: `[Common-Principles](https://github.com/SathishKumar9866/system-design-interview-prep/blob/backlinks_test/../basic/prep/Common-Principles.md)`

#### After:

- **File Renamed to**: `Common-Principles.md`
- **Link Updated to**: `[Common-Principles](https://github.com/SathishKumar9866/system-design-interview-prep/blob/backlinks_test/../basic/prep/Common-Principles.md)`

### Instructions:

1. **Run the Script**:
   - The script will first rename any files that contain spaces in their names to use hyphens, and then update all backlinks to reflect these changes.
   - It will print the renamed files and the updated links.

2. **Check the Output**:
   - After the script has run, check your local repository to confirm that:
     - Files with spaces in their names have been renamed.
     - Backlinks have been updated accordingly.

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Once you're satisfied with the results, push the changes to your GitHub repository.
