This section could use some updates. Consider [[system design primer?tab=readme ov file#contributing]]!

Security is a broad topic. Unless you have considerable experience, a security background, or are applying for a position that requires knowledge of security, you probably won't need to know more than the basics:

- Encrypt in transit and at rest.
- Sanitize all user inputs or any input parameters exposed to user to prevent [[Cross site_scripting]] and [[SQL_injection]].
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Use the principle of [[Principle_of_least_privilege]].
